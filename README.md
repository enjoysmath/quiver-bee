# Quiver🐝: a modern commutative diagram editor useable on all web platforms

[Official Quiver🐝 live site](https://enjoysmath.github.io/quiver-bee/)

This repository is a fork of original author varkor's diagram editor [quiver](https://q.uiver.app).

> **quiver** is a modern, graphical editor for commutative and pasting diagrams, capable of
rendering high-quality diagrams for screen viewing, and exporting to LaTeX via tikz-cd.   -varkor

Mathematical areas of use include Category Theory, Homological Algebra, Topos Theory, and essentially any heavily arrow-based subject.

> Creating and modifying diagrams with **quiver** is orders of magnitude faster than writing the
equivalent LaTeX by hand and, with a little experience, competes with pen-and-paper.  -varkor
